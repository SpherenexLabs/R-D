Yes 👍 — every time you open a **fresh terminal** on your Raspberry Pi, you need to activate the Python virtual environment (`mpu6050env`) before running your scripts. Otherwise, you’ll see errors like *“No module named board”* or *“No module named adafruit\_mpu6050”*.

---

## Step-by-step (starting fresh)

1. **Open terminal**
   (you’re at `admin@raspberrypi:~ $`)

2. **Go to your project folder**

   ```bash
   cd ~/Desktop/Smart
   ```

3. **Activate your environment**

   ```bash
   source ~/mpu6050env/bin/activate
   ```

   Your prompt will change to:

   ```
   (mpu6050env) admin@raspberrypi:~/Desktop/Smart $
   ```

4. **Run your script**

   ```bash
   python3 pi_knee_ultra.py
   ```

   (or `python3 MPU6050_US.py` / `python3 pi_mpu6050_knee.py` depending on the file you’re testing).

---

## Why?

* The **virtual environment** (`mpu6050env`) holds the special libraries (Adafruit Blinka, MPU6050 driver, etc.).
* If you don’t activate it, Python uses the **system default**, which doesn’t have those packages installed.

👉 Do you want me to also show you how to make it so your environment **auto-activates** when you enter `~/Desktop/Smart` (so you don’t have to type `source ~/mpu6050env/bin/activate` every time)?
